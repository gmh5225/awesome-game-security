# PatchGuard

Windows Kernel Patch Protection: periodic integrity checks over critical kernel structures; tampering can trigger a BSOD. Constrains SSDT/global hook styles and pushes hostile code toward less-monitored or below-OS techniques. (source: wiki/sources/skills/windows-kernel.md)

## Interaction with anti-cheat

AC kernel components coexist with PatchGuard rather than replacing it. Research often studies timing/context/hypervisor evasions of PG alongside AC callback integrity and [[hvci]].
